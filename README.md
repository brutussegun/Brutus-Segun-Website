# Hello World. 

I am Brutus. This is my first push to Git from my machine. Hoping I can figure it out quick. 

I will be pushing my front-end page to the Git as I work on it as a personal learning project. This project is supposed to show my journey with html, css, bootstrap, and eventually javascript.
